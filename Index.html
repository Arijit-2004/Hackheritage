        Due to socioeconomic inequality and restricted access to high-quality education, dropout rates in India continue to be a serious problem, especially in rural regions. High dropout rates impede academic advancement and economic growth, emphasizing the need for focused interventions and better infrastructure to provide fair access to education for everyone.

        <h2>Rates of Learning Interruptions </h2>
    <br>
        <p>The school system in India has historically been quite concerned with dropout rates. Although enrollment rates have increased over time, dropout rates—particularly at the basic and secondary levels—remain a serious problem. These high dropout rates are caused by a number of things, such as socioeconomic inequality, poor infrastructure, and cultural norms. Many children have difficulties that cause them to quit school early, especially in rural and economically deprived areas. These difficulties frequently include having to support the family financially or not having access to a good education. India has been adopting numerous programs and policies to address this issue, including the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, which both seek to lower dropout rates. However, reducing dropout rates in India has to make consistent efforts to guarantee that all students have equal access to education and to foster an atmosphere where they may stay in school and finish their degrees, boosting their future chances and fostering national growth.
